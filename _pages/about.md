Making data FAIR—findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible—has become the recurring theme behind many research
data management efforts. _dtool_ is a lightweight data management tool that packages metadata with immutable data to
promote accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility. Each dataset is self-contained and does not require
metadata to be stored in a centralised system. _dserver_ makes dtool datasets findable, hence rendering the dtool
ecosystem fit for a FAIR data management world.

This landing page collects various resources distributed across the web to offer a coherent entry point into data
management with dtool.
