[datalad-dtool](https://datalad-dtool.readthedocs.io) is an experimental extension for [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) that exports dtool datasets from DataLad datasets and imports dtool datasets as external sources into DataLad datasets by means of a custom [git-annex special remote](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/)

[solidipes](https://solidipes.readthedocs.io) is a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)-based Python package that helps researchers with curation and publication of their data. Solidipes will be able to import dtool datasets, help to fill out missing metadata, and provide a pathway for publishing them on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and other data repositories.
